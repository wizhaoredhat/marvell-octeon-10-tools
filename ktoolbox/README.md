ktoolbox
=======

Then `ktoolbox` package contains some basic utilities. It's (current) primary location is
ocp-traffic-flow-tests ([1]), but it can be reused by just copying the entire directory.

If you copy/fork the directory, make sure to not modify the fork. Instead,
extend the primary location first, and then reimport all files. This is to
avoid diverging implementations. It requires self-constraint.
